# Spoken in Silences

A quiet thread of emotion woven through yarn, code, and color.  
This portfolio is a sanctuary for handcrafted design, abstract expression, and heartfelt storytelling.  
Each page speaks softly — in textures, in pauses, in sound, in silences.

## ✨ Vision
Spoken in Silences is more than a website — it is a living gallery.  
Here, abstract art and handcrafted items are presented with clarity, harmony, and protection.  
Every element reflects a balance of technical precision and emotional resonance.
